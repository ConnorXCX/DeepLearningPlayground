# Another common type of machine learning problem is regression, which consists of predicting a continuous value
# instead of a discrete label: for instance, predicting the temperature tomorrow, given meteorological data or
# predicting the time that a software project will take to complete, given its specifications. In this example,
# weâ€™ll attempt to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given data points
# about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, and so on.
